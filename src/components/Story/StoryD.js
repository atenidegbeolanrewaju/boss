            A haze of smoke rose above the industrial city, which, even a decade later, was still reeling from the internal war that had taken place.

            <h3 className='story-h3'>The Family was broken.</h3>
            <p className='story-p'>
            Oh, his associates were out there, still, somewhere – well, they may no longer be in the city, but they were cunning men (for the most part, he conceded), and they knew all the warrens and hidey holes as well as the rats. Those that were alive were undoubtedly in hiding or pursuing new enterprises.

Truthfully, though, they were no longer his people, his connections. No, they had cut ties when they saw the powerful Don Paulo brought to heel by that meddlesome mayor and his lackey Bashir. 

It was a humiliation he would wear the rest of his days. At least his Father hadn’t lived to see his failure. 

He laced his hands behind his back, taking in a deep breath and letting it expire slowly. He was nothing now, a penniless pauper with no money, no property, and no power. 

“How did it come to this?” he wondered aloud, his voice a heavy bass. 

There were only two other souls present in the small, dingy room, his Underboss “Pap,” and the One. The former was smart enough to realize that this was rhetorical, and the other was sleeping peacefully. 

As the silence stretched out, Paulo turned from the cracked window, his eyes seeking the crib resting in the center of the dingy floor. His feet made deep thuds, stirring dust, as he crossed to it and peered at the One, his cherub face so smooth and free of worry. 

Paulo glanced at Pap, “He needs to know what happened.” 

The other hesitated, yet said nothing at first. Finally, he dipped his head and responded, “Of course, Don. He needs a history lesson, yeah. He’s got a lot ta learn.”

“Indeed he does. And it’s a story he’s going to hear over and over, because it’s his story, more than ours.” 

“Sure,” Pap agreed. He wasn’t the smartest, but he was loyal and that’s why the Don loved him. After all, he was still here when there was really no reason to be. After all, with the venture he had planned, he was reasonably sure that it would take a miracle for him to come through the other side, so he needed a protegé, someone to keep marching after he fell. Perhaps Pap wasn’t the best choice, but he was what there was. 

Settling down in an old rocker,  Paulo cleared his throat. As he leaned back in the chair, Paolo got up and filled a cup of water from the sink, placing it on the small side table next to him. 

After a moment, he leaned forward, brushing the baby’s hair with his fingers. At his touch, the child’s blue eyes sprang open and Don Paulo smiled. 

“It all started when my Father, the Don, passed away. . .”

Bashir watched the drone’s camera footage as it zoomed around the estate gardens, then rose as it approached the mansion itself, remaining out of view, but zooming in so he could see the guards in place. They were dressed in black tuxes and leaned against the banister as though they were guests, but the way they held themselves told him otherwise. 

The drone zipped to a new location, near where his men were hiding beneath a canopy on the far side of the pool. He had a clear view of the entry point, a side door with a single guard. 

He raised a hand to the drone operator beside him, then punched a button on his laptop, speaking into the mic on his headset, “Strike is a go. Main target is Paulo, but take out as many as you can. I want his family completely eradicated, and any associates who may be present, too. They need to know where the real power lies in this city.” 

“Affirmative,” a voice returned. 

To his drone operator, he commanded, “Follow the action as best you can, sweep the area to ensure there are no surprises in store for us.” 

The other man nodded and the view on the screen before them shifted, panning around the estate. The grounds were empty now, as the coronation had already begun. 

“Not today, Don Paulo,” he muttered under his breath. Not ever, if he had his way.

There was a sudden report of gunfire, a few short bursts, then all hell broke loose. The two guards at the gate fell, one taking out one of Bashir’s own men as he fell, his gun flashing. 

His men rushed the door, disappearing inside, presumably fanning out as planned. The drone could not see what was happening inside, but he had ears through his headset. There were screams and he could tell that shots were being fired on both sides. 

The combat seemed to go on an eternity, even though it couldn’t have lasted more than five minutes. The gunfire eventually dissipated, followed by a few shots periodically as his men secured the estate, tracking down any stragglers. 

When all was quiet, he scratched at his beard in satisfaction, then leaned back and crossed his arms, awaiting the report. 

None came. As time stretched on, he became impatient and slapped the mic button, “REPORT, what is the status of the mission?” Another long moment passed. “I said, REPORT.” 

He was about to speak a third time when a voice came over his headset, “Boss, we have a problem.” 

At those words, Bashir felt his heart sink, “What? The Don is not dead? What happened?” 

“Sir, the Don is dead, but, uh, it’s the wrong one.” 

“WHAT?”

“It appears we have been misled. This was a coronation, but a standard new member coronation for Don Lugoso. By the time we realized, it was too late, and they were firing back. We experienced heavy casualties, but wiped them out.”

Icy claws gripped Bashir’s heart. Paulo had tricked them, and now he had initiated a blood war on a different Mafia. 

“Get out of there!” he screamed into his headset.

“Are the Eyes in place?” Paulo asked, straightening his tie and looking at himself in the tall stand mirror. He ran a comb through his hair, ensuring that no strand hair ruined his coronation. 

“You look sharp, Boss,” Pap said, grinning. He, too, was dressed to the nines, a red rose pinned to his coat. “Yeah, they’ll let us know if Bashir shows his ugly face.” 

Turning from side to side, Paulo nodded in approval, then lit a cigar. As he exhaled the smoke, he said, “My sources say he’s in bed with the Mayor. He can’t get over how we swept in and won the Caralon contract, so now he throws a tantrum, like a child. It is sickening to see a great man brought low, forced to hide in the shadow of politics.” 

“You said it, Boss. So, uh, the tables are set and everyone’s gatherin’ for the Coronation. Shall we?” 

“Yes, let’s – wait,” Paulo pulled out his phone and read the message that had appeared. The pasta is cooked. 

He laughed heartily, “Our mole did a great job. Bashir opened our little present for him. This is a good day, indeed. Let’s go.” 

On his way through the casino, Paulo paused to pull the lever of a one-armed bandit. 

The slots spun, revealing seven . . . seven . . . cherry. So close. 

No matter, his big payout had already come.

“ . . . it seemed as though we were on top of the world. I became Don and we seemed invincible. Bashir’s attention was divided, trying to wage war with us and juggle the retribution from Don Lugoso’s Family. With our primary adversaries thus occupied, we prospered.” 

Paulo stopped, taking a long drink from the cup on the table. 

Pap had changed the One’s diaper, and he now rode his companion’s knee, burbling happily. “Those were good times, eh, Boss?”

“The best.” He massaged his temple with his fingers for a long moment, “And now we turn to dark days.” 

“For you see, The One, our actions forced Bashir deeper into the Mayor’s pocket. While I detest the man, I must respect him. He is ambitious and clever, and even our subterfuge was unable to put an end to him. 

“Under Bashir’s manipulation and influence, the Mayor set a series of events in motion that spelled the end, not just for our Family, but for Lugoso’s new replacement, Don Henri’s, as well. 

“You see, Bashir discovered the identity of our mole, the one whose information and cleverness made it possible for us to so successfully mislead him. Only, rather than eliminating the threat, he used him against us, playing our own plot against us to devastating effect. 

“The Mayor had a plan in place, unknown to anyone, and unbelievably, he managed to keep that secret. We do not know how Bashir managed to locate all of our moles, as well as those of the other Families, but he kept security airtight and fed us misinformation through our own men.

“It happened so quickly that there was no time for counter measures. They had been tracking our finances, you see, and one day – poof, nothing. All our money, accounts, and transactions had been tracked, then hacked, transferring our assets to the Mayor’s own bankroll. 

“While we struggled to right the boat, like the rats they are, our associates abandoned ship. I cannot blame them, it has always been a common policy to sever ties when a contact takes a mighty hit or becomes the target of a powerful enemy. Self-preservation. 

“We were spread thin, trying to put out too many fires at once, when Bashir struck again, and this time his aim was true. The fires that fueled his rage were too great for a simple slaughter, no – he wanted a slow death for us. 

“With the mayor in his pocket, he raided our property and seized all of our assets. We fought back, of course, and many died, but many of our own associates betrayed us, allowing our nemesis a clean sweep of all that remained. 

“We had nothing. Our Kingdom had fallen during my time as Don. Exiled from the city along with Don Henri. We made peace with his family, but during the struggle to survive, lost contact. 

“Now the mayor has promoted Bashir to maintain order. He has taken to calling himself Don Bashir as a further insult and keeps the city in a tight grip. 

“What’s worse, the mayor wanted to make sure we could never rise again. Cursing our family as the root of all the city’s past problems, he managed to pass a law preventing the ownership of land, a crazy thing where no one can buy or own land over the age of five years old. 

“The fools in the city do not understand that while it makes it difficult for us to rise again, it also assures that the mayor is in control of virtually all city assets. Truly, I have to respect his guile, tenacity, and ambition. 

“Nonetheless, we have a plan. Yes, you are The One who will lead the Rebirth of our Family. Yes, little One, in your blood runs the strength of two Families.

“I have already set plans in motion. We must rebuild the Family and restructure for solidarity. We need a Don, a Capo, and many, many Soldiers. We have to rebuild our connections with our Associates, and rise again. 

“To do this, we need to seek strength in others and rebuild. Our target – the Central Bank. Yes, One, we will purchase the bank itself and wrest control back from the Mayor and Bashir. We will control money in circulation, protecting our transactions. We will build an enterprise the likes of which the world has never seen. 

“Yes, we will own this city, but that is just the beginning.

“The road will be long, little One, but today, here — this is where your destiny begins. Today is your coronation, DeDon Baby. May the world tremble at your feet.”
